Small dataset Transfer Learning

A model of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based on transfer learning for image recognition.
This means to use a Deep CNN system pretrained on the large ImageNet dataset of 14 million images and 1000 classes in order to learn feature selection.
The results of the pretraining phase are transferred to the problem of classification for the images belonging to the UC Merced Land Use dataset with 21 classes.
